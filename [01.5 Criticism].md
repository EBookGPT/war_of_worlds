This story, while showcasing a potentially interesting premise, suffers from a severe lack of depth and falls prey to the dreaded "telling" rather than "showing." The author relies heavily on exposition, leaving the reader with a passive experience devoid of emotional engagement. 

**Here's a breakdown of the issues and how to address them:**

**1.  Character Development is Shallow:**

* **Davaa:**  He's an elder with wisdom, but we see little of that wisdom in action. His internal struggles and how his beliefs are challenged are glossed over. 
* **Temujin:** He's the "chosen one" trope, but his motivations and growth feel underdeveloped. His connection to the Xar is stated rather than shown.
* **Baatar:** He's a stock "exiled warrior" character. We need more about his history, his reasons for joining the fight, and his inner conflicts.

**Fix:** Instead of telling us about their traits, show us through their actions, reactions, and internal monologues.  Give them unique voices and motivations.

**2.  Dialogue is Non-Existent:**

*  We hear no actual conversations between characters. There's no sense of how they interact or influence each other. 
*  The communication with the Xar is described as a "language of light," but we don't get a sense of what that language is like or how it affects Temujin. 

**Fix:** Dialogue is essential to bringing characters to life. Give us snippets of conversation, showing power dynamics, emotions, and internal struggles. Make the communication with the Xar more tangible. How does the light feel? What kind of images does it evoke? 

**3.  Narrative is Flat:**

* The story unfolds in a predictable, almost textbook fashion.  There are no unexpected twists, turns, or moments of suspense.
* The descriptions are often generic and lack vivid imagery.  "The steppe" is mentioned repeatedly, but we never truly experience it.

**Fix:** Introduce conflicts and challenges that raise the stakes.  Focus on the sensory details of the steppe, its smells, sounds, textures, and how it impacts the characters.  Let the narrative flow organically, not in a step-by-step expositional manner. 

**4.  Overuse of Exposition:**

* Too much of the story is told, rather than shown.  We're told that the Xar are advanced, we're told the Tenger are resilient, we're told that the world is threatened.  
* The "whispers of the wind" device is heavy-handed and feels like a crutch for the author to convey information rather than create believable plot points.

**Fix:** Let the reader infer things. Show the Xar's technological prowess through their actions.  Let the Tenger's resilience manifest in their strategies and choices.  Use the "whispers of the wind" sparingly and only to evoke a specific sense of mystery or foreshadowing.

**5.  Missing the Big Picture:**

* The story lacks a sense of the larger implications of the Xar's invasion.  We don't see the impact on other cultures, nations, or the global response.  The focus feels too narrow.

**Fix:**  Expand the scope. Show how the Xar's arrival ripples outwards, affecting different factions and creating alliances and conflicts. This will elevate the story from a local conflict to a global threat.

**Final Thoughts:**

This story has the potential to be compelling.  However, it needs a significant rewrite to focus on showing, not telling.  Develop your characters, create engaging dialogue, use vivid imagery, and build suspense.  Explore the broader implications of the Xar's invasion, and don't be afraid to take risks and experiment with your narrative. Remember, the reader should be actively engaged, not passively absorbing information.
